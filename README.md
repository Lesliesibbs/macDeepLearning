Setup and configuration help for external eGPUs on a Mac System. 

- NVIDIA Titan Xp gpu (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/titan/titan-xp/)

- AkiTio Node Pro enclosure (https://www.akitio.com/expansion/node-pro)

- Cabling: If using Thunderbolt 3 cables, the cable must be the high speed version (40 gbps). A USB-C end is not sufficient for high speed transfer.  Cables over 0.8m may not allow for 40gbps transfer speeds.  If using TB1/TB2, you need the TB3 -> TB2 adapter (https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter) and a standard TB2 cable. (note: the TB3 plug goes into the eGPU and the 



There are two paths that can be considered â€“
*  Manual installation of NVIDIA web drivers and CUDA, but this approach still requires an OS patch to enable eGPU support. 

*  The second is to use on of the all-in-one scripts that are now available. Check the license agreements on the scripts to make sure they are consistent with your needs. 

This guide is going to use option 2, building upon the tremendous work happening at eGPU.io.  The script by learex is all encompassing and recommended as the first resource to try.

Step 1: Back up

There will be several important changes to the OS and the configuration. You may elect to do a full system backup before beginning to a new external drive via Time Machine. If you have a previous Time Machine backup, this can be used, but sometimes, it is easier to have just one clean backup to work from. 

You can speed up the first back up by using this command in the Terminal:
```
sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=0
```

After the back up has been completed, re-enable the low priority task throttling
```
sudo sysctl debug.lowpri_throttle_enabled=1
```

Step 2: disable system integrity protections (referred to as SIP frequently online)

In the terminal, enter
```
csrutil disable
```

Reboot

Verify status:
```
csrutil status
```
At this point, SIP should indicate it has been disabled.

Step 3: Run the macOS-eGPU script

IMPORTANT: The eGPU should be disconnected from the computer at this point. You can have it all assembled, but do not plug it into the computer at this time.

Using the up-to-date documentation on @learex page, run the automated script. You can view and verify the code he uses on GitHub. This is a good practice to consider when running code at the administrator level on your computer.


* First a test run of the command

Note that this bash script has a -C (capital C) flag. Running this in this way will just check the system, install the macos-egpu program, but not install anything. It will do a series of checks with the flag.  After running this, use just the short cut command and flags as noted in the next step.

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learex/macOS-eGPU/master/macOS-eGPU.sh) -C
```

* Run a second time but using no flags (automatic installation mode)

Since the program is already install, simply run the following

```
macos-egpu
```

And follow the instructions on the screen.

* Reboot and rerun

Depending on your system configuration, you may need to reboot and rerun the `macos-egpu` script multiple times. Older machines will need to have a TB1/TB2 patch. The system will automatically install the latest NVIDIA CUDA drivers and Web Drivers.   If you are using the AkiTio Node Pro, the chipset is T83, so you can indicate no to the question when prompted. 

* Run "Check" one more time

```
macos-egpu -C
```

Verify that all looks well and there are no scheduled updates.

Step 4: Configure CUDA

* Install CUDA

If after running the check above you find that CUDA and the smaples are not installed, you can install them using the following commands

Execute the following command to have the GPU CUDA drivers installed 
```
macos-egpu --cudaDriver
```

Install the toolkit, which should also include the samples.
```
macos-egpu --cudaToolkit
```
If the samples are not installed, the following can be used to install them. They are helpful for testing the GPU once it is attached. 

```
macos-egpu --cudaSamples
```

The computer will have CUDA 9.2 installed. For the CUDA to be fully operational for deep learning, system parameters need to be set.

* Edit `.bashrc`

Change to your home directory (`cd ~` from a terminal). 

type
```
nano .bashrc
```

In the editor window, paste in the following parameters

```
export PATH=/Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-9.2/bin${PATH:+:${PATH}}

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/Developer/NVIDIA/CUDA-9.2/lib\ ${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}}

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

If you are not used to using nano, use control o to write the file changes to disk. Then use control x to close (note: this is control and not the typical Mac command).

* Edit the `.bash_profile` file

```
nano .bash_profile
```

Then paste in this command
```
if [ -f $HOME/.bashrc ]; then
        source $HOME/.bashrc
fi

```
Command o followed by command x to save and exit the nano program.

* Reboot

While you might have success bashing the profile files, it is simplier to just reboot.

Step 5: Install cuDNN

Access to NVIDIA deep learning libraries requires access to their developer site. They grant free access, but you must register.

Go to developer.nvidia.com and follow the steps for registration.
