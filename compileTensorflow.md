Draft Steps to compiling Tensorflow 1.5 with GPU Support for a Mac.

Notes on the configuration commands.

For most items, you will say no. 

For the cuDNN version, you need to match the file name of `libcudnn.7.dylib` stored in /usr/local/cuda. For the time being, that is a numeric 7. No decimal places.

```
computer:tensorflow m070316$ ./configure
You have bazel 0.9.0-homebrew installed.
Please specify the location of python. [Default is /Users/username/anaconda3/bin/python]: 


Found possible Python library paths:
  /Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages
Please input the desired Python library path to use.  Default is [/Users/username/anaconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages]

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Google Cloud Platform support? [Y/n]: n
No Google Cloud Platform support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Hadoop File System support? [Y/n]: n
No Hadoop File System support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with Amazon S3 File System support? [Y/n]: n
No Amazon S3 File System support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with XLA JIT support? [y/N]: n
No XLA JIT support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with GDR support? [y/N]: n
No GDR support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with VERBS support? [y/N]: n
No VERBS support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with OpenCL SYCL support? [y/N]: n
No OpenCL SYCL support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Do you wish to build TensorFlow with CUDA support? [y/N]: y
CUDA support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Please specify the CUDA SDK version you want to use, e.g. 7.0. [Leave empty to default to CUDA 9.0]: 9.2


Please specify the location where CUDA 9.2 toolkit is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]: 


Please specify the cuDNN version you want to use. [Leave empty to default to cuDNN 7.0]: 7


Please specify the location where cuDNN 7 library is installed. Refer to README.md for more details. [Default is /usr/local/cuda]:


Please specify a list of comma-separated Cuda compute capabilities you want to build with.
You can find the compute capability of your device at: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus.
Please note that each additional compute capability significantly increases your build time and binary size. [Default is: 3.5,5.2]6.1


Do you want to use clang as CUDA compiler? [y/N]: n
nvcc will be used as CUDA compiler.

Please specify which gcc should be used by nvcc as the host compiler. [Default is /usr/bin/gcc]: 


Do you wish to build TensorFlow with MPI support? [y/N]: n
No MPI support will be enabled for TensorFlow.

Please specify optimization flags to use during compilation when bazel option "--config=opt" is specified [Default is -march=native]: 


Add "--config=mkl" to your bazel command to build with MKL support.
Please note that MKL on MacOS or windows is still not supported.
If you would like to use a local MKL instead of downloading, please set the environment variable "TF_MKL_ROOT" every time before build.

Would you like to interactively configure ./WORKSPACE for Android builds? [y/N]: n
Not configuring the WORKSPACE for Android builds.

Configuration finished
```

Now compile based on the above configuration

```
bazel build --config=cuda --config=opt --copt=-msse4.2 --copt=-mpopcnt --copt=-maes --copt=-mcx16 --verbose_failures --action_env PATH --action_env
```
